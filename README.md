## some technical background
<details open>
<summary>design choice</summary>


<ul>
<li>
    In the last project I used JavaScript for React, but there was numerous issues such as lack of 
    enum, and unpredictable behaviour in function parameter. Therefore, I use TypeScript for this project.
    I place focus on simplicity and clarity of structure, and do not aim to provide the most feature in this project.
</li>
<li>
    I used more functional component and hook than the previous project. React does not really have inheritance so class method
    is not reusable across component. Hooks however can.

<li>
    The drag drop event
